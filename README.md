# Excel-Billionaires-Dashboard
This project explores the global billionaire dataset to uncover patterns in wealth distribution and industries. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, the project highlights which countries and industries produce the most billionaires, identifies the top wealth holders, and examines trends such as age and net worth distribution.The insights are presented through an interactive dashboard that makes it easy to compare, filter, and explore billionaire data across different dimensions.


📊 Project Overview
Data Source: Curated list of the top billionaires worldwide in 2025.

Analysis Goals:
- Track billionaire rankings by net worth.
- Compare wealth across industries such as technology, fashion, finance, and retail.
- Study demographic distributions (age, gender, nationality).
- Link billionaire wealth to broader macroeconomic indicators like GDP, tax revenue, life expectancy, and population.
- Explore trends in self-made vs. inherited wealth.
